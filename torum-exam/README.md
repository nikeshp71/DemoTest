# React Native Test

To initiate the project, you'll need the following minimum requirement on your machine:

- Node 16 or higher
- Ruby 2.6.10 or higher

This test project showcases efficient listing from a public REST API. It also demonstrates users' ability to add or delete comments on specific articles.

Article listing data are stored in mobile storage, enabling offline access without an internet connection. Data security is ensured through encryption in mobile storage.

To start the project, follow your usual steps or try my convenient scripts:

Run npm run common. If you encounter any issues, don't worryâ€”I've included a demo for swift review.

For a quicker code review, I've prepared a PR for your convenience.

Best regards,
Nikesh Patel
